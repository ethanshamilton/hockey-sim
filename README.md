# hockey-sim
This is going to be a hockey simulator. The goal is to make a 2D hockey simulator
like Eastside Hockey Manager, with as realistic simulation as I can manage. My plan
is to mostly utilize stats-based simulation, but I'm going to model some extent of physics
so that we can accurately portray time and space in a hockey game.
